This dissertation aims to challenge and extend our understanding of gastropopulism. Gastropopulism is an emerging field, currently with a very narrow scope, examining only its use by right-wing actors, largely in the Italian context. What and how a political actor publicly eats signals their taste and identity, particularly of class and cultural preferences, access, and belonging. This dissertation provides a multidimensional analysis of how gastropopulism is used by left- and right-wing actors in the UK and US (_Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez_; _Donald Trump_; _Jeremy Corbyn_; _Nigel Farage_), through mixed-methods analysis of images and videos [n=163]. The methods used are: statistical analysis; quantitative interactive timeline visualisations paired with inductive qualitative thematic analysis; deductive qualitative thematic analysis; multimodal social semiotics timeline transcription. This enables a robust examination of gastropopulism, ultimately supporting my performance-based approach that seeks to disentangle the phenomenon from ideological assumptions. This dissertation concludes that political actors across the ideological spectrum use multimodal gastropopulist performances as an impression management strategy to construct and legitimise their public identities. These findings suggest the need to radically review the theories and methodologies of gastropopulism research, in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding.
