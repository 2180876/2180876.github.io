I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Timothy Peace, who has been a wonderful source of support. His enthusiasm for this project and understanding of my vision has been hugely motivating and reassuring. 

My magnificent flatmate, Eleanor, has provided endless patience, proof-reading, and positivity. My family and friends have been so encouraging, and I am very lucky to be surrounded by such incredible people. My favourite part of creating this dissertation has been that when talking about it, everyone has an example of a politician doing something _weird_ or _funny_ or _unexpected_ with food. Hearing so many engaged perspectives has helped to keep me going through this journey.

Finally, I am so grateful for Ulrik Lyngs, who created the `Oxforddown` R template used to produce this dissertation (Lyngs, 2019). This has enabled me to centre multimodal communication, through including images and dynamic visualisations. 

**Author’s Note**:
Unfortunately, `Oxforddown`’s automatic HTML to PDF export would not work (the PDF button on the toolbar does not generate the complete paper) so I had to manually reformat the dissertation, by individually knitting each chapter, saving as PDF, and stitching them together. This means that for the PDF: the page numbers reset each chapter; there are awkward page breaks, particularly around images/visualisations/tables; the interactive/dynamic elements of tables and visualisations do not work. These issues are unfortunately unavoidable. As such, I strongly recommend readers stick to the HTML format, as this is optimised for my multimodal, dynamic dissertation. Producing this dissertation for the HTML format using `RStudio` and `Oxforddown` has been a significantly challenging experience, however, I believe it has been worth it and has resulted in a rich and engaging dissertation. 

TurnItIn seems to be struggling with the PDF format, saying there are 3,346 words for my draft. This is not the case. I used the `wordcountaddin` R package to keep track of each chapter’s word count, and summed the results to get my final. For clarity, I decided to include Appendix C, which presents word counts for individual chapters and the total.
